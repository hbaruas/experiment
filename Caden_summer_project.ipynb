They are calculated as the percentage of firms with increasing turnover, minus the percentage of firms with decreasing turnover.\\nThese estimates have been weighted according to each industry's contribution to the economy. As services have the greatest contribution, they have a greater contribution to the total index.\\nThe indices are constructed to lie between 1 and negative 1. An index of 0.05 means that 5% more firms reported an increase in turnover compared with the previous month than those reporting a decrease in turnover. Conversely, an index of negative 0.05 means that 5% more firms reported a decrease in turnover compared with the previous month.\\nEmbed codeEmbed this interactiveCopy\\nThese data are current price so may reflect elements of inflation.\\nThe shaded areas represent the 95% confidence limits.\\nThe confidence limits are 1.96 standard deviations of the seasonally adjusted series, centred around zero.

They are calculated as the percentage of firms with increasing turnover minus the percentage with decreasing turnover.\\nFor the first time, these estimates have been weighted according to each industry's contribution to the economy. As services have the greatest contribution, they likewise have a greater contribution to the total index.\\nThe indices are constructed to lie between 1 and negative 1, so an index of 0.05 means that 5% more firms reported an increase in turnover compared with the previous month than those reporting a decrease in turnover. Conversely, an index of negative 0.05 means that 5% more firms reported a decrease in turnover compared with the previous month.\\nThe data are seasonally adjusted.\\nMore information on the compilation and methodology of these estimates can be found in ourEconomic activity and social change in the UK, real-time indicators methodology.\\nEmbed codeEmbed this interactiveCopy\\n.xlsx\\nAfter seasonal adjustment, a net 3% of firms in December 2022 reported increased turnover on the previous month, compared with a net 2% who reported decreased turnover in December 2021. Production had the highest net percentage of firms reporting an increase, with 7%, followed by construction, with 4%, and services with 2%. Agriculture was the only sector where a net percentage of firms reported decreasing turnover, with negative 6%.\\nData for all available industries, including seasonally adjusted month-on-month estimates and non-seasonally adjusted month-on-month and month-on-year estimates, for turnover and expenditure, are available in ouraccompanying dataset: VAT flash estimates.\\nInitial results from Wave 74 of theBusiness Insights and Conditions Survey(BICS)\\u00a0were collected from 9 to 17 January 2023, with a response rate of 23% (9,045 responses).\\nTable 1: Less than a fifth (18%) of businesses currently trading expected turnover to decrease in February 2023 (beyond usual seasonal fluctuations), down from 29% who expected January 2023 turnover to decrease when asked in the previous monthBusiness turnover expectations, businesses currently trading, weighted by count, UK, November 2022 to February 2023Expect turnover to increaseExpect turnover to stay the sameExpect turnover to decreaseNovember 202211.9%53.4%21.2%December 202213.1%48.6%24.4%January 202310.1%48.0%29.2%February 202313.6%52.7%18.2%Source: Office for National Statistics \\u2013 Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS)NotesInitial weighted results Wave 74 of the Office for National Statistics' (ONS') Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).Table rows may not sum to 100% because of rounding and percentages less than 1% being removed for disclosure purposes.Download this tableTable 1: Less than a fifth (18%) of businesses currently trading expected turnover to decrease in February 2023 (beyond usual seasonal fluctuations), down from 29% who expected January 2023 turnover to decrease when asked in the previous month.xls.csv\\nSource: Office for National Statistics \\u2013 Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS)\\nNotes\\nThese figures are experimental estimates of online job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, by category and by UK country and English region.

This reflects seasonal trends seen in previous years where job advert numbers increase in the middle of January after declining over the Christmas and New Year periods.\\nThe number of online job adverts increased in 27 of the 28 job categories and decreased in just one category (\\\"scientific/QA\\\"). The largest increase was in the \\\"charity/voluntary\\\" category, which rose by 13%, followed by \\\"sales\\\" and \\\"catering and hospitality\\\" both increasing by 11%. However, the number of online job adverts in the \\\"charity/voluntary\\\" and \\\"sales\\\" categories have been below the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) baseline since November 2022 and June 2022, respectively.\\nThe total number of online job adverts was 14% lower than the level seen in the equivalent period of 2022. Of the 28 online job advert categories, 10 were above the level seen in the equivalent period of 2022, while the remaining 18 were below this level. The \\\"part time/weekend\\\" category experienced the largest increase compared with the previous year, rising by 33%. \\\"Manufacturing\\\" decreased by 43% compared with the previous year and has been below the level of the previous year since mid-May 2022.\\nFor the first time since mid-November 2022, all 12 of the UK countries and English regions saw increases in the number of online job adverts in the latest week. However, this mirrors what happened last year and is strongly influenced by the effects of seasonality. Northern Ireland saw the largest increase of 14%, while online job adverts in the North East recorded the smallest increase, rising by 5%. Only two regions reported an increase in online job adverts compared with the equivalent period in 2022; adverts in Scotland and Northern Ireland were 11% and 6% above 2022 levels, respectively.\\nThe number of potential redundancies reported in the week to 8 January 2023 was 116% above the level in the equivalent week of 2022, while the number of employers proposing redundancies was 110% higher compared with the level in the equivalent week of 2022.

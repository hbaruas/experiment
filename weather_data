Hi Steph,

Thanks for your message, and for looking at this from the ethics perspective.

To clarify: this project is using publicly available job advert data supplied by Textkernel, which already exists within the DAP environment and is used across several other labour demand outputs. The purpose of our work is to identify and quantify the share of roles in the UK labour market that involve data production activities, based on how job responsibilities are described.

At this stage, the work is entirely exploratory, and we’re simply requesting the installation of a few standard Python and NLP libraries to support basic text processing. We are not processing sensitive data, linking datasets, or storing any personally identifiable information. All outputs are aggregated (e.g. by SOC code or sector), with no individual-level analysis or re-identification risk.

Wider project context:
This work supports a broader effort to better understand data as an economic input — that is, how data is being produced and used across sectors and occupations in the UK. The goal is to inform future thinking around data infrastructure, digital skills, and the strategic value of data within the economy. We’re building on the OECD’s “Data as a Driver of Growth” framework but applying it empirically using UK-specific job advert data already in DAP.

Happy to provide more detail or complete an ethics self-assessment if needed.

On your question — no, an ethics self-assessment has not been completed yet, but I’m very happy to complete one if you feel that would be appropriate at this stage.

Best wishes,
Saurabh

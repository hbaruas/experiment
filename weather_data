Slide 1: Title Slide
Visuals on Slide: * Title: Measuring the Economic Value of Data Assets in the UK
•	Subtitle: A Text-Based NLP Approach
•	Your Name / Title
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining me. Today, I am going to walk you through a highly specialized macroeconomic pipeline we have built. Our primary objective for this project was to solve a notoriously difficult economic problem: How do you put a concrete, billion-pound price tag on an invisible asset? We are going to explore exactly how we used Natural Language Processing, analyzing over 60 million UK job advertisements, to accurately measure the true monetary value of data assets across the UK economy. I'll spend the next 20 minutes breaking down the methodology step-by-step so you can see exactly how the math works under the hood, and then I will share the final economic valuations and charts we generated, leaving plenty of time for questions at the end."
 
Slide 2: The Macroeconomic Problem
Visuals on Slide: * The Challenge: Data is an intangible asset missing from traditional balance sheets.
•	The Solution: The OECD "Sum of Costs" Approach.
•	The Logic: We measure the cost of the human capital hired to build, manage, and analyze the data.
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"Let’s start with the core macroeconomic problem. In modern economics, 'Data' is arguably the most valuable asset a company owns. However, unlike physical assets—like a factory machine or a fleet of delivery trucks—data is completely intangible. You cannot simply look at a company's balance sheet and point to a line item that shows the exact monetary value of their internal databases.
To solve this, we adopted the methodology established by the OECD, which relies on the 'Sum of Costs' approach. The logic here is incredibly straightforward: If a bank spends a year building an internal customer database, there is no receipt. It isn't sold on the open market, so it has no official price. Therefore, the value of that data asset is exactly equal to what it cost the company to build and maintain it. If we can figure out exactly how many 'data workers' exist in the UK economy, and how much they are paid, we can accurately calculate the overall economic investment in data. But to do that, we first have to find them. And today, data work isn't just done by 'Data Scientists'. It's done by Marketing Managers running analytics, Senior Nurses managing patient databases, and Logistics Coordinators tracking supply chains."
 
Slide 3: Defining the "Anchors" (SOC 2020)
Visuals on Slide: * Goal: Teach the AI the true vocabulary of data work.
•	The Anchor Pillars (SOC 2020):
o	Data Entry: (SOC 4152 - Data entry administrators)
o	Database Management: (SOC 2134 & 3133 - Developers & DBAs)
o	Data Analytics: (SOC 3544 & 2433 - Analysts & Statisticians)
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"To find these hidden data workers, we used Natural Language Processing to read millions of Textkernel job advertisements. But before we can ask an AI to find 'data skills,' we have to teach it what a data skill actually looks like.
We do this by looking at the vocabulary used by known, indisputable data professionals. We call these our 'Anchor Occupations.' To ensure our dictionary is built on the purest possible definition of data work, we mapped our pipeline exclusively to the newest UK SOC 2020 classifications, which recently introduced dedicated codes for modern data professionals.
We grouped these into three specific pillars: Data Entry, capturing roles like Data Entry Administrators; Database Management, capturing Programmers and Database Admins; and Data Analytics, capturing Data Analysts and Statisticians. By isolating the job adverts from these highly specialized groups, we establish the 'gold standard' vocabulary of data work."
 
Slide 4: Phase 1 - The NLP Engine & Semantic Similarity
Visuals on Slide: * Process: Extract Noun Chunks $\rightarrow$ Calculate Cosine Similarity to "Data".
•	The 0.35 Threshold: Balancing Semantic vs. Functional concepts.
•	Example: "SQL Database Management" (Score: 0.45) vs. "Office Catering" (Score: 0.05).
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"Once we established our anchors, we booted up our AI engine. The pipeline reads a job advert, extracts the distinct phrases—or 'noun chunks'—and filters out anything that has absolutely nothing to do with data.
It does this by calculating the mathematical 'Cosine Similarity' between every phrase and the core concept of the word 'data'. However, we had to make a critical architectural decision here. AI language models inherently understand semantic synonyms better than functional tools. A strict 0.50 threshold would only allow direct synonyms like 'statistics' into our dictionary, while wrongfully deleting functional software languages like 'SQL' or 'Python'.
To solve this, our pipeline applies a precisely calibrated 0.35 semantic threshold. This perfectly strikes the balance: it allows the actual functional technology stack of the UK economy into our analysis, but safely discards unrelated terms. For example, 'office catering' scores a 0.05 and is instantly deleted, while 'SQL database management' scores a 0.45 and safely passes into the next phase."
 
Slide 5: Phase 2 - The "Generic Buzzword" Problem (Max-RF)
Visuals on Slide: * The Problem: Spreadsheets are used by Analysts and Teachers. How do we isolate specialized skills?
•	The Solution: Maximum Relative Frequency (Max-RF).
•	Formula: (% of Anchor jobs using word) $\div$ (% of Economy jobs using word) $\ge$ 10.0x
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"At the end of Phase 1, our AI gave us a massive list of phrases semantically related to data. But we face a major problem: Not all data words represent specialized data work. The word 'spreadsheet' is highly related to data, but almost every office worker in the UK uses one. If we count everyone who uses a spreadsheet as a 'Data Professional,' we will massively inflate the economy.
To solve this, we rely on a metric called Relative Frequency. We compare how often a word appears in our Anchor Occupations versus how often it appears in the broader UK economy.
Take the phrase 'machine learning'. It might appear in just 0.5% of the general economy, but it appears in 15% of all Data Analyst adverts. That means a Data Analyst is 30 times more likely to use this word. The OECD methodology strictly requires a word to hit a 10.0x multiplier to be added to the official dictionary. We calculated this for Data Entry, Database, and Analytics independently, and if a word achieved a 10.0x multiplier in any of those three branches, it survived."
 
Slide 6: Methodological Armor (Defending the Dictionary)
Visuals on Slide: * 1. The "Valid Universe": Calculates probability only against tech-enabled jobs.
•	2. Document Frequency: Words must appear in $\ge$ 500 distinct job adverts.
•	3. The Gold Standard Polish (Phase 2.5): $\ge$ 0.45 similarity against 20 foundational tech pillars.
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"Now, frequency math can occasionally be tricked, so we applied three layers of 'Methodological Armor' to protect our dictionary.
First, the 'Valid Universe' denominator. If we included millions of silent, non-technical jobs—like manual labor or retail—in our math, the baseline frequency for any technical word drops to near-zero, which artificially inflates our multipliers. We prevented this by calculating probability strictly within the subset of job adverts containing at least one data term.
Second, we applied a strict volume threshold. Because we processed 60 million records, a word had to appear in a minimum of 500 distinct job adverts to be considered a real macroeconomic skill, killing off isolated recruiter typos.
Finally, Phase 2.5. We subjected the surviving 10,000 words to one final AI exam. The model evaluated every word against 20 undeniable tech pillars—like 'Python', 'Cloud', and 'Algorithm'. To pass, a word had to achieve a strong 0.45 similarity score against at least one pillar. This guaranteed that every single term in our final OECD Dictionary was functionally and undeniably anchored to the modern data economy."
 
Slide 7: Phase 3 - Finding the Hidden Data Workers
Visuals on Slide: * The OECD Threshold Rule: A job advert must contain $\ge$ 3 distinct dictionary words to be classified as "Data-Intensive."
•	Example A: Marketing Manager (Python, Data Warehouse, Predictive Modeling) $\rightarrow$ Data-Intensive
•	Example B: Warehouse Supervisor (Inventory Spreadsheet) $\rightarrow$ Non-Data
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"With a pristine dictionary locked in, we zoom out. We stop looking exclusively at our IT jobs and scan every single job advertisement in the UK economy. We instruct the algorithm to count how many unique words from our dictionary appear in the text of each advert.
To ensure that data work is a core part of the role—and not just a passing mention—we apply the strict OECD Threshold Rule: A job must contain at least 3 distinct dictionary words to be classified as 'Data-Intensive.'
For example, a Marketing Manager advert asking for Python, Data Warehousing, and Predictive Modeling hits the threshold and is successfully classified as a hidden data worker. Conversely, a Warehouse Supervisor whose only technical task is updating an inventory spreadsheet only scores 1 hit, and is correctly classified as Non-Data. By running this across millions of rows, we calculate exactly what percentage of every occupation in the UK is engaged in heavy data work."
 
Slide 8: Phase 4 - The Sector Mapping Problem (SOC vs. SIC)
Visuals on Slide: * The Disconnect: Occupations (SOC) vs. Industries (SIC).
•	The Solution: The Census Crosswalk Matrix.
•	Transforming historical headcount into a real-time Probability Distribution.
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"At the end of Phase 3, we know exactly how many data jobs exist in each occupation. But we face a massive macroeconomic hurdle. Our job adverts are categorized by what people do—their SOC codes. But to calculate monetary value, we need official government tables, which are categorized by where people work—their SIC Industry codes.
Job adverts rarely explicitly state their industry. So, we bridged this gap using official UK Census Data. We mathematically transformed historical Census headcounts into a 'Probability Crosswalk Matrix'.
Instead of looking at absolute numbers, we ask the data: Out of all the Software Developers in the UK, what is the probability that one works in Finance? If the Census shows that historically 30% of them work in Finance, we allocate 30% of our real-time job adverts to the Finance sector. This allows us to successfully map dynamic, real-time job market data into static, official government industry sectors."
 
Slide 9: Phase 5 - Putting a Price Tag on Data (The SUT)
Visuals on Slide: * The Ledger: ONS Supply and Use Tables (SUT) - Intermediate Consumption.
•	Key Extractions:
o	Compensation of Employees (COMP_EMP): The baseline cost of human capital.
o	Gross Value Added (GVA): The total economic footprint of the sector.
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"This brings us to Phase 5: Putting a price tag on the data. To find out how much money is flowing through the UK economy, we use the official Supply and Use Tables provided by the Office for National Statistics.
Specifically, we use the 'Use Table at Purchasers' Prices'. This table acts as the master receipt for the entire UK economy, tracking exactly what every industry spends to operate. From this massive ledger, our pipeline programmatically extracts two crucial pillars for every single sector.
First, the Compensation of Employees. This is the absolute total amount of wages, salaries, and pensions paid to all workers in that sector. This is our baseline cost of human capital. Second, the Gross Value Added, or GVA. This is the total economic footprint generated by the sector, which tells us the size of the sector so we can calculate our final investment percentages."
 
Slide 10: The Alpha ($\alpha$) Capital Markup
Visuals on Slide: * What is Alpha? Scaling wages to total investment value.
•	$\alpha$ = Total Output $\div$ Compensation of Employees
•	The Confidence Band:
o	Lower Bound: 1.58 (Conservative international benchmark).
o	Upper Bound: Sector-specific UK markups (capped at 3.62 economy average).
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"However, the true economic cost of a data asset is significantly larger than just a worker's base salary. Think of the contractor analogy again: the cost of a new house is not just the builder’s hourly wage. The total cost includes their insurance, their physical tools, the operational overhead, and a margin of profit.
To account for this, we use the Alpha Markup. Alpha is our multiplier. It mathematically scales a raw labor cost up to represent the total investment value. Following the OECD, the formula is Total Output divided by Compensation of Employees.
Because the Alpha markup is a macroeconomic estimate, we present our findings as a range—a transparent Confidence Band. The Lower Bound uses a conservative, flat multiplier of 1.58 utilized by Statistics Canada, representing the absolute minimum capital footprint of an office worker. The Upper Bound uses our highly specific, calculated UK markups derived directly from the 2025 Blue Book, which average out at 3.62 across the economy."
 
Slide 11: The Valuation Example (Sector K: Finance)
Visuals on Slide: * Inputs: 5.0% Data Intensity | £100B Total Wages | £200B GVA | $\alpha$ = 3.91
•	Step 1 (Data Wages): £100B $\times$ 5% = £5 Billion
•	Step 2 (True Investment): £5B $\times$ 3.91 $\alpha$ = £19.55 Billion
•	Step 3 (Economic Intensity): (£19.55B $\div$ £200B GVA) = 9.77% of Sector Output
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"Let’s trace the final math for the Finance sector for a single year to see how this all comes together.
From our AI classification, we know that 5% of all jobs in the Finance sector are Data Analytics jobs. From the SUT tables, we know the Total Wages paid in the sector is 100 Billion pounds, and the GVA is 200 Billion pounds. Our calculated Alpha markup for Finance is 3.91.
First, we allocate 5% of the total wages to data work, giving us 5 Billion pounds paid directly to Data Analysts. Second, we multiply those wages by our 3.91 Alpha to capture the true total investment the banks made to support those workers, giving us 19.55 Billion pounds. Finally, we divide that investment by the total 200 Billion GVA of the sector.
The final verdict? The UK Finance sector invested an amount equal to 9.77% of its total economic output specifically into Data Analytics assets. Our pipeline calculates this formula dynamically across all 10 industry groups, for all 3 data pillars, across all 6 years of data."
 
(Note: You will now transition to the final 4 slides where you paste in the charts you generated from Phase 6. Here is exactly what you should say for each one to fill the remaining 10-12 minutes).
Slide 12: Overall UK GVA vs. Data Investment Scenarios
Visuals on Slide: * (Insert fig_macro_abs or fig_macro_pct showing the three lines: Sector Map, Economy Avg, and Conservative).
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"Now that we understand the methodology, let's look at the actual results across the UK economy. This chart plots the total national Gross Value Added against our three data investment scenarios over time. The light blue line at the bottom represents our absolute, conservative floor using the 1.58 Alpha. The top line represents our upper bound, utilizing the highly specific sector markups. What is immediately striking here is not just the sheer scale of the investment—which reaches into the tens of billions of pounds—but the resilience of the trend. Even amid broader economic fluctuations shown by the national GVA, the percentage of the economy dedicated to processing and managing data remains an undeniably massive, structural component of modern UK business."
 
Slide 13: Data Investment Intensity by Sector
Visuals on Slide: * (Insert fig_sec_pct line charts showing the different SIC codes).
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"When we break this macroeconomic view down into specific industries, the true value of the Census Crosswalk matrix shines. Here we are looking at Data Investment Intensity as a percentage of each specific sector's GVA. Naturally, Information and Communication (Sector J) and Financial Services (Sector K) show heavy structural investments in data. But more interestingly, we can observe the silent digitization of traditional industries. We are seeing quantifiable, billion-pound investments in data infrastructure occurring within Manufacturing and Wholesale distribution—proving that our AI model successfully identified those 'hidden' data workers managing logistics algorithms and supply chain databases far outside of traditional tech companies."
 
Slide 14: Absolute Volume of Data Jobs (Industry Heatmap)
Visuals on Slide: * (Insert fig_heat_counts showing the absolute volume of jobs by SIC code).
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"To ground those percentages in absolute human terms, this heatmap displays the raw volume of Data-Intensive job advertisements demanded by each sector. The darker the orange or blue, the higher the volume of hiring. While a sector like Real Estate might have a high percentage of data investment relative to its small workforce, this heatmap proves where the absolute bulk of UK human capital is moving. Professional Services, Finance, and Public Administration are consistently generating tens of thousands of specialized data roles every single year, serving as the absolute engines of the UK's data economy."
 
Slide 15: Top Occupations Driving the Data Economy
Visuals on Slide: * (Insert fig_heat_soc_pct or fig_heat_soc_vol showing the top 20 SOC codes).
What to Say (Read this out loud):
"Finally, we can look exactly at who is doing this work. This heatmap isolates the Top 20 specific Standard Occupational Classifications that are driving this data economy. Unsurprisingly, our anchor occupations like Programmers and Data Analysts dominate the top slots. But because of our 3-word classification rule, we successfully captured the broader workforce. We are capturing the Business Project Managers, the Financial Managers, and the Marketing Directors who are actively writing SQL, managing cloud infrastructure, and running predictive models.
This proves that 'Data' is no longer just an IT function; it is a foundational skill required at the management level across the entire UK economy.
That concludes the methodology and our primary findings. Thank you very much for your time. I would now like to open the floor to any questions you might have about the pipeline, the AI parameters, or the economic valuations."

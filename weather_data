One-to-One Feedback – Talking Points for Ayoola

Start with encouragement:

“Ayoola, thanks for all your hard work over the last few months. You’ve picked up a lot, and I appreciate the effort you’ve put into each of the projects so far. Since you’re nearing the end of your probation, I just wanted to take some time to go over what’s gone well, and also talk through a few areas where there’s room for growth.”

Project-Based Feedback

1. TextKernel Project

“You did a good job on the formatting side, which was great to see. The bit we were hoping for more progress on was making the pipeline more dynamic—essentially so a user could run everything from one file, with the inputs all in one place. That’s how we aim to structure most of our pipelines, so users don’t have to run multiple scripts or hunt around for inputs.”

⸻

2. Dataloft Project

“This one had already gone through the difficult seasonal adjustment part—your task was mainly to get it into the publishable format. You got there in the end, but it took a little longer than we expected. As you gain more familiarity, these formatting tasks should feel quicker and more manageable.”

⸻

3. Code Review Project

“You started strong with the code review work and covered good ground. Just a reminder though—given the size of the pipeline, ideally we’d expect a couple of projects to be reviewed in a day. It also would’ve been a great opportunity to wrap it up with a short summary or even a quick presentation. That would help show the value of what you’ve done and how it contributes to the bigger picture.”

⸻

4. Shipping R&D Project

“This was an R&D-style task where we were expecting something a bit more conclusive—maybe a short note, slides, or a summary of what you explored. You pulled together resources well, but it felt like the work just stopped short of completion. With R&D, showing your thinking and suggesting next steps is often more important than a finished product.”

⸻

5. VAT Pipeline

“This one was a bit unclear—when it came time to check in, neither you nor Aly were fully sure where the work had landed. That’s a reminder of how important it is to keep communication open and stay aligned with the rest of the team, especially when tasks are shared.”

⸻

6. David’s Team – Swimlane C

“You’ve been involved from the start, which is great. But when I asked for updates, I didn’t hear back until I asked again. Just a nudge here to be more proactive in keeping us in the loop—it really helps build trust and shows you’re on top of things.”

⸻

Wrap-Up Summary and Encouragement

“One pattern I’ve noticed is that you tend to start tasks quite well, but sometimes don’t take them all the way through to a clear finish or communicate outcomes back to the team. That’s something we’d like to see improve—bringing that extra bit of follow-through.”

“Also, if you ever feel like you’re unsure about how to approach something—whether it’s Power BI, Python, or anything else—please say so. We’d rather know early and support you than have you stuck. You don’t have to figure everything out on your own.”

“The main thing from our side is: be more proactive. Ask questions, check in regularly, share what you’re thinking—even if it’s half-baked. That kind of engagement makes a big difference.”

“And finally, I want you to enjoy the work. We know it’s a learning curve, and that’s totally okay. What matters is showing you’re growing, asking when you need help, and owning the work from start to finish.”

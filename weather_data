Hi Rhys,

Thanks for raising this — happy to clarify.

We are processing publicly available job adverts (including job descriptions) purely to identify and quantify how many roles involve data production activities. The purpose is analytical and aimed at understanding broader labour market trends — no attempt is made to extract or store personal contact information from the adverts.

We do not use or retain names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other identifying fields. Furthermore, the analysis does not link adverts to specific individuals or organisations. The results are aggregated and used only to derive high-level insights, such as the share of roles contributing to data creation across sectors or regions.

Even in cases where a job title might appear specific (e.g. a rare role such as a Data Protection Officer), the outputs are anonymised and summarised at occupational or industry levels, with no potential for re-identification.

Please let me know if a DPIA is needed, though we believe this sits well within low-risk processing with no personal data retained.

Best regards,
Saurabh

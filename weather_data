Dear Matt,

I hope you’re having a good start to the week.

I have my Norway visa appointment this Thursday morning and, unfortunately, Oracle Fusion is currently down, so I cannot download my formal leave approval record.

To satisfy the embassy's "Proof of Leave" requirement, could you please reply to this email confirming that my leave has been approved? For the visa officer's records, the reply needs to explicitly state the dates.

Could you please reply with something like:
"I confirm that Saurabh Kumar’s leave request for his holiday from [Insert Start Date] to [Insert End Date] has been fully approved, and he is expected back at work on [Insert Return Date]."

I am sorry for the short notice on this, but having this email confirmation is a mandatory requirement for my appointment on Thursday.

Thank you for your help,

Saurabh Kumar

Certainly, Saurabh. Here is your final single response, rewritten precisely for the ONS AI Approval (Step 2) Detailed Submission form. This version:
	•	Reflects that there is no direct OECD collaboration
	•	Clarifies that the project is based on an OECD methodology
	•	Emphasises that the models are not AI or LLMs
	•	Addresses Security, Legal, Ethics, and KIM concerns in a direct, formal tone

Title

Use of SpaCy en_core_web_md and en_core_web_lg Models to Reproduce OECD Methodology for Labour Market Task Classification

⸻

Short Description

This project aims to reproduce and test the task classification methodology described in an OECD white paper focused on measuring “Data as an Asset” in the labour market. The methodology involves analysing job advertisements to classify and quantify the presence of data-related tasks (such as data entry, database management, and analytics) across occupations and sectors.

We plan to apply this methodology to the Text Kernel job advert dataset available in the DAP environment, using lightweight natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify relevant noun phrases and compute their similarity to reference task categories. This approach allows us to assess the evolving nature of digital and data-related work in the UK labour market.

To carry out this work, we request installation of the open-source SpaCy models en_core_web_md and en_core_web_lg. These models are:
	•	Publicly available and MIT-licensed from the SpaCy NLP library
	•	Pre-trained, static language models used for tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, and vector-based similarity calculations
	•	Entirely rule-based and deterministic; they do not learn from data, generate new content, or adapt in any way
	•	Designed to run locally, without any internet connectivity or external API dependencies
	•	Commonly used in academic and public sector NLP work for reproducible and explainable analysis

These models do not meet the definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Large Language Models (LLMs) as defined by ONS, CDP, or central government guidance. They do not perform generative tasks, do not connect to external services, and are not used to automate decisions.

⸻

Security, Legal, Ethics, and KIM Considerations
	•	The models are offline, self-contained, and do not require or initiate any internet connection
	•	The analysis is conducted on non-personal, publicly sourced job advert data
	•	No personal or sensitive information is used, stored, or exposed
	•	There are no legal, ethical, security, or KIM concerns
	•	The methodology is fully transparent and outputs are deterministic and auditable
	•	Results will be used for internal research and statistical insight purposes only

Installing these SpaCy models within DAP will enable scalable processing and monthly refresh of indicators aligned with OECD methodology, supporting the Real-Time Indicators programme’s goals of timely and reproducible labour market analysis.
